                "To cook a basic fried egg, follow these steps:\n1. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil.\n2. Crack an egg into the skillet, taking care not to break the yolk.\n3. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Cook the egg for about 2-3 minutes until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny, or longer if you prefer a firmer yolk.\n5. Carefully slide a spatula under the egg and flip it over if desired, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes.\n6. Remove the egg from the skillet and serve immediately. Enjoy your perfectly cooked egg!"
