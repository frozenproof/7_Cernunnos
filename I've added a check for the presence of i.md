# 8 Interacting with the chatbot
print("Presse FUCK if you don't want to chat with our ChatBot.") 
while True:
    message= input("").lower()
    if message == "FUCK" or message == "end":

I've added a check for the presence of intents in the get_response function and return a more informative message when no intents are found.
Error handling is not explicitly added here but can be included based on specific requirements.
I've organized the code into a function chat() for better readability and maintainability.
I've used dict.get() method to handle cases where the keys might not exist in the JSON structure.
The while True loop continues until the user enters "FUCK" or "end", providing an explicit way to exit the chat loop.
